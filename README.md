## Description
The application uses a [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to create a queryable employee directory with React. The website pulls in data from its API and shows it in an easy to read table. The employees can be filtered by searching for a specific phone number. Additionally, when the "Name" category is clicked, the employees will be sorted by their name alphabetically, descending and ascending.
